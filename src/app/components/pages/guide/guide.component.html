        <p>We want you to demonstrate your ability to write code following the
          <a href="https://angular.io/guide/styleguide"
            target="_blank">Angular style guide</a> which is well
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage" target="_blank">covered</a> by unit tests using
          <a href="https://jasmine.github.io/" target="_blank">Jasmine</a>. In other words, as much as the correctness of the solution (e.g. providing validation), we are looking
          for proper usage of Angular concepts or whatever you deem pertinent to make your code easy to read and to maintain.</p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> is present along with the
          <a href="https://ng-bootstrap.github.io/#/home" target="_blank">ng-boostrap</a> components library, use them whenever there's a need to style your components. Additionally there
          are some example components to help you get started.</p>
        <p>This exercise can be done in a few hours, but please donâ€™t rush and take the time you need. Just remember that we
          are looking for quality of code over quantity. Refactor and clean your code.</p>
        <p>If you have any questions, or you encounter any issues, please send us an
          <a href="mailto:AppsDevInterviewProcess@teksystems.com">email</a>.</p>

        <p>Before starting, modify the app component located in the /src/components/app folder so that it displays your name
          in the navbar instead of the "[your name here]" default placeholder.</p>
        <p>If you had any issues, please document them in the
          <a href="#" (click)="goToTab($event, 'comments')">Comments</a> tab by replacing the text that is present there, see the guide page component located in the /src/components/pages/guide
          folder.</p>
        <p>When writing code:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Create as many TypeScript, HTML, and SCSS files as you feel is appropriate.</li>
          <li>
            Run the tests with coverage using the "npm run coverage" (see ./package.json for other commands).
            <br> A coverage report is created in the /coverage folder after all the tests are run. You can open the index.html
            report file in your favourite browser to view the report.
          </li>
          <li>Make sure your code coverage all your written code and it's at least at 80%.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You should not need any external resources to complete the user stories, in the case you really do, please document
          them in the
          <a href="#" (click)="goToTab($event, 'thought-process')">Thought Process</a> section.</p>
        <p>When working on each story at least one git commit must be made. Don't commit all the user stories in one bundle.</p>
        <p>Once complete push your changes to the repository and notify your recruiter.</p>

        <p>The goal of the exercise is to Build a Temperature monitor application using Angular and Boostrap by completing the
          following user stories:</p>
        <h4>User Story #1</h4>
        <p>As an anonymous end user, I want to be able to navigate to the "Records" page and see the "Add records" form.</p>
        <h5>Acceptance Criteria & Definition of Done</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>A new page component Records should be created in the /src/app/components/pages folder.</li>
          <li>It should be linked to the navbar component src/app/components/common/navbar using the /records path and in the
            router located at /src/app.router.ts</li>
          <li>The new page should include the jumbotron common component featuring the "Temperature records" title.</li>
          <li>Below the jumbotron should be present a form with:
            <ul>
              <li>a label named "Temperature record";</li>
              <li>a temperature text input field;</li>
              <li>a submit button named "Add".</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Using
            <a href="https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/components/forms/" target="_blank">Boostrap</a> to style the form is
            <strong>mandatory</strong>.</li>
          <li>The form should be responsive.</li>
          <li>The new page component must be unit tested for the presence of all elements described.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>User Story #2</h4>
        <p>As an anonymous end user, I want to be able to enter maximum 8 temperature records, by entering a value and then
          clicking on the "Add" button.</p>
        <h5>Acceptance Criteria & Definition of Done</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Create a new stateless service named "TemperatureMonitor" that adds records in an array.</li>
          <li>When entering a record in the form and clicking the "Add" button the service is called to store the records.</li>
          <li>The component should not allow more than 8 values to be added in the store.</li>
          <li>Once the stored maximum values are reached the "Add" button should be disabled.</li>
          <li>Add new unit tests to the page component spec file to cover the new functionality.</li>
          <li>A unit test file should also be created for the new service to cover its functionality.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>User Story #3</h4>
        <p>As an anonymous end user, I want to see the progress of added records.</p>
        <h5>Acceptance Criteria & Definition of Done</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Add a new
            <a href="https://ng-bootstrap.github.io/#/components/progressbar/examples">ng-bootstrap progress bar</a> component on the page below the add button with a label of your choice above.</li>
          <li>The progress bar should reflect the number of records added / maximum records (e.g. 2/8) and should be filled accordingly.</li>
          <li>The color of the progress bar should be green, when 8 maximum records are hit it should become red.</li>
          <li>Add new unit tests to the page component spec file to cover the new functionality.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>User Story #4</h4>
        <p>As an anonymous end user, I want to be prevented from entering and invalid value such as strings in the "Temperature"
          input field.</p>
        <h5>Acceptance Criteria & Definition of Done</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>The component should allow the service to be called only with numeric values.</li>
          <li>Using
            <a href="https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/components/forms/#validation">Bootstrap</a> and
            <a href="https://angular.io/guide/form-validation">Angular</a> form validation the user should be informed when an error has occurred.</li>
          <li>Here are some of the possible invalid actions:
            <ul>
              <li>The user tried to add a string instead of a number;</li>
              <li>The user tried to add an empty value.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Add new unit tests to the page component spec file to cover the new functionality.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>User Story #5</h4>
        <p>As an anonymous end user, I want to be able to see the median of the entered temperature records that I have entered.</p>
        <h5>Acceptance Criteria and Definition of Done</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Create a new button named "Get Median" next to the "Add" button.</li>
          <li>Using a
            <a href="https://ng-bootstrap.github.io/#/components/popover/examples">ng-bootstrap popover</a> display the current
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median" target="_blank">median</a> value for the entered records when hovering the button.</li>
          <li>The "TemperatureMonitor" service should be responsible for calculating the median.</li>
          <li>The "Get Median" button should be disabled if no records are present in the store.</li>
          <li>Add new unit tests to the page component spec file to cover the new functionality.</li>
        </ul>

    <ngb-tab id="comments" title="Comments">
      <ng-template ngbTabContent>
        <p>
          <b>Story 1:</b>
          <br>To start, changed directory in Angular CLI to [src/app/components/pages folder] and generated a component named,
          'records', using (ng g c records).
          <br> Edited the HTML page(records.component.html) to display heading 'Temperature records'.
          <br> Added heading tag(h4 tags) to also display 'add records' below the page title.
          <br> Updated the links on navigation bar to reflect the records component and also in the [app.routing.ts]
          <br> Used reference from w3.schools to create a form using bootstrap. Defaulted to w3 schools as it's familiar.
          <br> The input field with type listed as number was still accepting 'e' as valid input. Per research the number class
          allows for shortcut in writing long numbers using 'e'. For example, 200 can be written as 2e2 which is essentially
          2*10^2. This will be benefical if an application requires big numbers. I decided to disable the feature so no string
          can be created with this code[type="number" onkeydown="javascript: return event.keyCode==69? false: true"]
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>Story 2:</b>
          <br>Created a service with Angular CLI(ng g service TemperatureMonitor). Placed the service in the app folder and exported
          class to make it available for the components.
          <br>Created an array called TempsRecords and declared type as number, since data to be received should be an integer.
          <br> Used service to grab input and to push data to array.
          <br>Set 'Add' button to disable after array length is 8. Also set the input field to be required field. Without data
          the 'add' button is diable to prevent empty data from being submitted.
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>Story 3:</b>Added a progress bar from [ng-bootstrap progress bar page]. Set striped and animated to true to give
          it some elegance rather than the stationary blocked color.
          <br> Used interpolation to dyamically changed the progress bar length and color, pulling values as the onsubmit function
          is called and data being pushed to array.
          <br> with Array length starting at zero, it was hard to show the progress bar with a zero value. changed formular to
          add plus 1 to array length and leave numerical length at 8 for mathetical logic. Got stuck on how to have progress
          bar changed dynamically without hard coding incase end-user switches array length.
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>Story 4:</b>
          Data validation was handled in story 2. Set input field not to accept or enable string hence user cannot type any alphabet.
          This will save user time and frustration of having to have option to type alphabets and later be told its invalid.
          Additional layer added to form group with validators to ensure service is only called with numeric value and not
          string or empty field.
          <br> Created a span which lets user know to enter temperature if input box is touched but no data entered.
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>Story 5:</b> Added button to the form and called it "Get Median". Did research on the math logic on how to get
          the median. Created the formular and relied on service for array in real time. Get Median is disable when service
          has an array with no length/empty array.
          <br> Used interpolation to dynamically populate Median figure in the Popover field. </p>
